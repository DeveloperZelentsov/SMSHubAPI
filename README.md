# Networking
Networking is a network layer for the application. It allows communication with the server and handles all network requests for the app. It is implemented using the Swift Package Manager and can be easily integrated into any project. With Networking, you can make HTTP requests, handle responses and errors, and parse JSON data.

To use Networking, simply add it as a dependency in your Package.swift file and import it wherever you need to make network requests. The API is easy to use and fully documented within the codebase.

Networking is constantly being updated and improved to provide the best experience for developers. Give it a try and streamline your networking code in your next project!
